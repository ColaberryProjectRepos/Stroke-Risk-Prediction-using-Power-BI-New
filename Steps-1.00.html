
Project Overview

<span style="font-family: Arial;">In an era where healthcare advancements are crucial, leveraging data science to predict medical conditions can transform patient care. Stroke, caused by an interruption or reduction in blood supply to the brain, is a significant health risk, with the World Stroke Organization reporting that one in four individuals over the age of 25 may experience a stroke in their lifetime. It is the second most common cause of death and the third most prevalent reason for impairment in adults globally. The profound impact of stroke on individuals, families, and healthcare systems underscores the necessity for precise and timely prediction techniques. This project aims to develop a predictive model using patient data to forecast stroke occurrences, thereby aiding healthcare providers in early intervention and personalized treatment plans. By analyzing various health metrics, we seek to identify individuals at high risk and provide actionable insights to enhance patient outcomes.</span>
