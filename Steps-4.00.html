<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Data sources and KPI</span></b></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The data was collected through a clinical study involving stroke patients from various hospitals and clinics. Medical records were reviewed to document incidences of stroke, heart disease, and hypertension, while current glucose levels were measured during routine health check-ups. The collected data was then analyzed to calculate the relevant KPIs.</span></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1539/4/3.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">System Architecture</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">System architecture refers to the way a system is structured and organized to achieve its goals. The image below describes the system architecture used to build the stroke risk prediction dashboard with Power BI.</span></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1539/4/4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Data Features</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Data features are specific aspects of raw data relevant for analysis, also known as feature data, and are used as input to machine learning (ML) models for training and prediction. My data features include independent variables such as age, glucose level, and BMI (continuous variables), as well as gender, marital status, and work type (categorical variables), with stroke as the dependent variable (target).</span></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1539/4/5.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
