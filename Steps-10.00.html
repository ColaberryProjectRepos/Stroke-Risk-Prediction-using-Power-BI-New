<p><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Dataset Quality</strong>: Acquiring a high-quality dataset was a major obstacle, as many datasets had gaps that made them unsuitable for the project. After working with two different datasets, which proved challenging for visualization, I ultimately used a third dataset for the final project.<p></p></li><li><p><strong>Code Compatibility</strong>: Running Python code generated in Numtra within Microsoft Fabric was a significant challenge. Some code had to be rewritten to ensure compatibility with the Fabric domain.</p></li><li><p><strong>DAX Formulas and Table Sorting</strong>: Understanding and creating DAX formulas and sorting tables was challenging. To address this, I watched YouTube videos and consulted Chat GPT for accurate DAX formulas. Additionally, creating step-by-step GIFs under 5MB was time-consuming, which I mitigated by increasing my clicking speed.</p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1539/10/5.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p><p><br></p></li></ol><p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p><p>Data preparation is a crucial step in the data analytics pipeline, ensuring that the data is of high quality and ready for analysis, which leads to more accurate insights and decisions.
